# TransferWise-CLONE
My attempt at recreating the TransferWise landing page using 100% my own code.

I did not design this page, color scheme or layout; this design belongs entirely to TransferWise and was designed by Venture Three.

----------

All code is 100% my own and was started as an exercise to learn how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together outside of a sandbox environment such as CodePen.
I made a screenshot of the TransferWise website and wrote down how the page reacted when sizing the browser window down.
Once I had created the page itself, I wanted to learn how to utilise JavaScript on a real project, so I clicked around the real website to see how each element behaved and tried my best to create the same behaviour using again, all my own code (having never even looked at the TransferWise source code).

----------

Once again, this design belongs to Venture Three and TransferWise!
