# TransferWise-CLONE
My attempt at recreating the TransferWise landing page using 100% my own code.

I did not make this design; this design belongs entirely to TransferWise and was designed by Venture Three.

----------

All code is 100% my own and was started as an exercise to learn how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together outside of a sandbox environment such as CodePen.
I made a screenshot of the TransferWise website and wrote down how the page reacted when sizing the browser window down.
Once I had created the page itself, I wanted to learn how to utilise JavaScript on a real project, so I clicked around the real website and recreated it.

----------

Once again, this design belongs to Venture Three and TransferWise!
